# Ego Is the Enemy
## Holiday, Ryan

### Chapter 1: THE PAINFUL PROLOGUE
> We must begin by seeing ourselves and the world in a new way for the first time. Then we must fight to be different and fight to stay different—that’s the hard part. I’m not saying you should repress or crush every ounce of ego in your life—or that doing so is even possible. These are just reminders, moral stories to encourage our better impulses.  --(*Location: 185  Page: xxiv*)

> The ego we see most commonly goes by a more casual definition: an unhealthy belief in our own importance. Arrogance. Self-centered ambition.  --(*Location: 210  Page: 2*)

> “If you start believing in your greatness, it is the death of your creativity.”  --(*Location: 238  Page: 4*)

> Humble in our aspirations Gracious in our success Resilient in our failures  --(*Location: 266  Page: 6*)

> So what is scarce and rare? Silence. The ability to deliberately keep yourself out of the conversation and subsist without its validation. Silence is the respite of the confident and the strong.  --(*Location: 457  Page: 26*)

> The only relationship between work and chatter is that one kills the other.  --(*Location: 486  Page: 28*)

> Think about this the next time you face that choice: Do I need this? Or is it really about ego? Are you ready to make the right decision? Or do the prizes still glitter off in the distance? To be or to do—life is a constant roll call.  --(*Location: 569  Page: 35*)

> mastery. The pretense of knowledge is our most dangerous vice, because it prevents us from getting any better. Studious self-assessment is the antidote.  --(*Location: 610  Page: 39*)

> Each fighter, to become great, he said, needs to have someone better that they can learn from, someone lesser who they can teach, and someone equal that they can challenge themselves against.  --(*Location: 615  Page: 39*)

> It’s why the old proverb says, “When student is ready, the teacher appears.”  --(*Location: 662  Page: 43*)

> The reality: We hear what we want to hear. We do what we feel like doing, and despite being incredibly busy and working very hard, we accomplish very little. Or worse, find ourselves in a mess we never anticipated.  --(*Location: 705  Page: 47*)

> Passion typically masks a weakness. Its breathlessness and impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose and perseverance. You need to be able to spot this in others and in yourself, because while the origins of passion may be earnest and good, its effects are comical and then monstrous.  --(*Location: 715  Page: 48*)

> What humans require in our ascent is purpose and realism. Purpose, you could say, is like passion with boundaries. Realism is detachment and perspective.  --(*Location: 728  Page: 49*)

> Passion is about. (I am so passionate about ______.) Purpose is to and for. (I must do ______. I was put here to accomplish ______. I am willing to endure ______ for the sake of this.) Actually, purpose deemphasizes the I. Purpose is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to pleasuring yourself.  --(*Location: 731  Page: 49*)

> Passion is form over function. Purpose is function, function, function.  --(*Location: 744  Page: 50*)

> Great men have almost always shown themselves as ready to obey as they afterwards proved able to command.—LORD MAHON  --(*Location: 751  Page: 51*)

>   --(*Location: 777  Page: 53*)

> Find canvases for other people to paint on. Be an anteambulo. Clear the path for the people above you and you will eventually create a path for yourself.  --(*Location: 783  Page: 53*)

> When you are just starting out, we can be sure of a few fundamental realities: 1) You’re not nearly as good or as important as you think you are; 2) You have an attitude that needs to be readjusted; 3) Most of what you think you know or most of what you learned in books or in school is out of date or wrong.  --(*Location: 784  Page: 53*)

> Greatness comes from humble beginnings; it comes from grunt work. It means you’re the least important person in the room—until you change that with results.  --(*Location: 816  Page: 56*)

> Maybe it’s coming up with ideas to hand over to your boss. Find people, thinkers, up-and-comers to introduce them to each other. Cross wires to create new sparks. Find what nobody else wants to do and do it. Find inefficiencies and waste and redundancies. Identify leaks and patches to free up resources for new areas. Produce more than everyone else and give your ideas away  --(*Location: 830  Page: 57*)

> Those who have subdued their ego understand that it doesn’t degrade you when others treat you poorly; it degrades them.  --(*Location: 899  Page: 63*)

> But you’re not able to change the system until after you’ve made it. In the meantime, you’ll have to find some way to make it suit your purposes—even if those purposes are just extra time to develop properly, to learn from others on their dime, to build your base and establish yourself.  --(*Location: 913  Page: 64*)

> Pride blunts the very instrument we need to own in order to succeed: our mind. Our ability to learn, to adapt, to be flexible, to build relationships, all of this is dulled by pride.  --(*Location: 1022  Page: 74*)

> Pride is a masterful encroacher. John D. Rockefeller, as a young man, practiced a nightly conversation with himself. “Because you have got a start,” he’d say aloud or write in his diary, “you think you are quite a merchant; look out or you will lose your head—go steady.”  --(*Location: 1039  Page: 75*)

> It isn’t “Don’t boast about what hasn’t happened yet.” It is more directly “Don’t boast.” There’s nothing in it for you.  --(*Location: 1076  Page: 78*)

> Fac, si facis. (Do it if you’re going to do it.)  --(*Location: 1120  Page: 82*)

> Every time you sit down to work, remind yourself: I am delaying gratification by doing this. I am passing the marshmallow test. I am earning what my ambition burns for. I am making an investment in myself instead of in my ego. Give yourself a little credit for this choice, but not so much, because you’ve got to get back to the task at hand: practicing, working, improving.  --(*Location: 1136  Page: 83*)

> “Man is pushed by drives,” Viktor Frankl observed. “But he is pulled by values.” Ruled by or ruling? Which are you?  --(*Location: 1267  Page: 99*)

> An amateur is defensive. The professional finds learning (and even, occasionally, being shown up) to be enjoyable; they like being challenged and humbled, and engage in education as an ongoing and endless process.  --(*Location: 1334  Page: 105*)

> When we are aspiring we must resist the impulse to reverse engineer success from other people’s stories. When we achieve our own, we must resist the desire to pretend that everything unfolded exactly as we’d planned. There was no grand narrative. You should remember—you were there when it happened.  --(*Location: 1400  Page: 111*)

> All of us waste precious life doing things we don’t like, to prove ourselves to people we don’t respect, and to get things we don’t want. Why do we do this? Well, it should  --(*Location: 1455  Page: 116*)

> Ego loves this notion, the idea that something is “fair” or not. Psychologists call it narcissistic injury when we take personally totally indifferent and objective events. We do that when our sense of self is fragile and dependent on life going our way all the time. Whether what you’re going through is your fault or your problem doesn’t matter, because it’s yours to deal with right now.  --(*Location: 1996  Page: 165*)

> The only way out is through.  --(*Location: 2037  Page: 168*)

> Dead time is revived when we use it as an opportunity to do what we’ve long needed to do.  --(*Location: 2081  Page: 173*)

> Doing the right thing was enough. Serving his country, his God, and doing his duty faithfully was all that mattered. Any adversity could be endured and any rewards were considered extra.  --(*Location: 2132  Page: 177*)

> It’s far better when doing good work is sufficient. In other words, the less attached we are to outcomes the better. When fulfilling our own standards is what fills us with pride and self-respect. When the effort—not the results, good or bad—is enough.  --(*Location: 2145  Page: 178*)

> 1. They almost always came at the hands of some outside force or person. 2. They often involved things we already knew about ourselves, but were too scared to admit. 3. From the ruin came the opportunity for great progress and improvement.  --(*Location: 2215  Page: 184*)

> “If you cannot reasonably hope for a favorable extrication, do not plunge deeper. Have the courage to make a full stop.”  --(*Location: 2306  Page: 192*)

> “He who fears death will never do anything worthy of a living man,” Seneca once said. Alter that: He who will do anything to avoid failure will almost certainly do something worthy of a failure.  --(*Location: 2331  Page: 193*)

> The question we must ask for ourselves is: Are we going to be miserable just because other people are?  --(*Location: 2461  Page: 205*)

> Aspiration leads to success (and adversity). Success creates its own adversity (and, hopefully, new ambitions). And adversity leads to aspiration and more success. It’s an endless loop.  --(*Location: 2501  Page: 209*)

> training was like sweeping the floor. Just because we’ve done it once, doesn’t mean the floor is clean forever. Every day the dust comes back. Every day we must sweep. The same is true for ego. You would be stunned at what kind of damage dust and dirt can do over time. And how quickly it accumulates and becomes utterly unmanageable.  --(*Location: 2526  Page: 212*)

> There’s a quote from Bismarck that says, in effect, any fool can learn from experience. The trick is to learn from other people’s experience.  --(*Location: 2578  Page: 216*)
